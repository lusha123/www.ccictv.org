<p align="left">CCIC-TV adopted AWANA Club as part of our children 
                ministry's outreach program on Friday night.</p>
              <p align="left">Because of Awana's vision .....<br><br />
		    <br />
                "Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman 
                who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the 
                word of truth."<br>
                II Timothy 2:15</p>
              <p align="left">It equips Churches and Parents in raising Christ-following 
                Kids for Life ,which is our church's commitment.<br><br />
			 <br />
                And..........<br>
		
                The goal of the AWANA club is to reach boys and girls with the 
                gospel of Christ, and to train them to serve Him", which is also 
                our church's calling. </p>
              <p align="left"></p><br />
		    <br />
              <p align="left">In the Awana program you will find new friends, 
                play exciting games, participate challenging contests, and receive 
                memorable awards. Furthermore, you will learn about God's words, 
                which will impact your whole life.<br>
                We have various names for different age groups. If you do not 
                know the name of the club you are in, the following list can help 
                you:</p>
              <p align="left">Cubbies– 3 and 4 year-old boys and girls<br>
                Sparks- kindergarten to 2nd grade boys and girls<br>
                T&amp;T (True &amp;Train)- 3rd to 6th grade boys and girls</p>
             
              <p align="left">AWANA provides a great opportunity for each child 
                to grow in Biblical knowledge and self-worth, as well as in relationship 
                with God and others. You can help your child grow in these areas 
                through AWANA program if you...<br>
                 Show interest in your child's achievement<br>
                 Encourage your child to come each week on time<br>
                 Work with your child in certain service sections and projects<br>
                 Help your child memorize at least two sections in the handbook 
                each week. <br>
                 Have your child relay to you what he/she has memorized and put 
              your initial at the bottom of each section </p><br />
		    <br />
              <p align="left"> Weekly rules......<br>
                - Clubbers must take part in the entire club program (unless a 
                note is received by the leader from a parent, or if a clubber 
                is excused by the commander)<br>
                - Clubbers must remain in the designated insurance-covered premises 
                at all times<br>
                - Clubbers must cooperate and obey the leaders. When the leader 
                announces the "5 count", clubbers must be quiet and come to attention.<br>
                - Three consecutive unexcused absences will put clubbers on probation. 
                And permission to return to the club meetings again will depend 
                only upon availability (only sick leave can count as an excused 
                absence)</p><br />
